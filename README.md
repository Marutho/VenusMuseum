Venus Museum is heavily inspired in Wario Ware. In our game, you traverse a museum finding paintings of relevant women in history and you should help them to achieve their goals. Each painting represents a minigame that references some of their achievements. 

We included some aragonese women like Conchita Martinez, one of the most influential tennis players in the world or Blanca Catal√°n, considered the first botanic in Spain.
